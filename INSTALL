SINS was developed and tested on Redhat 7.0, it needs the Qt
library from Troll Tech (http://www.trolltech.com) to work.
It has only been tested with Qt 2.2 and newer, at this time.
It requires the pcap library (libpcap) for packet capture.

SINS is derivative of ShowEQ.  If you are looking for that
package, you can get it at www.sourceforge.net/projects/seq.

libEQ.a requires libpthread and libz to both be installed on
your system.  If you don't have them, you'll need to get them
and install them.

The basic install is the same as any other GNU package:

./configure
make 
make install

This installs SINS in /usr/local/bin, and puts maps and logs in
/usr/local/share/sins/.
make install is important, the program will not find maps
without it.

Please note that SINS requires write access to the
/usr/local/share/sins directory at runtime, as this is where
the internal databases and configuration files are stored.  

Configuration values are stored in the file sins.conf.  The
search path for this file is:
	~/.sins/sins.conf
	<install dir>/sins.conf (probably /usr/local/share/sins)
	<install dir>/showeq.conf (ditto)

It should be noted that some/many of the options in showeq.conf
are not meaningful anymore, and that there are several/many new
options that are available and not present in a showeq.conf file.
Most of those options you should not have to edit in the .conf
file directly as the values can be changed within the application.
	
Filters for filtering spawns from the spawnlist and map can be
configured via a file specified in the config file
(typically 'filters.conf').  A sample file has been included
in the distribution which should be self explanatory.
Spawn Alert filters can also be configured here.  The search
path for these 2 files is:
	<location specified in sins.conf file>
	~/.sins/filters.conf (or alerts.conf)
	<install dir>/filters.conf (or alerts.conf)

It should be noted that the preferred way of editting these
files is not to use a text editor, but to use the dialog provided
inside SINS (Under the "Edit" menu).  There is an easy-to-use
dialog to add/remove arbitrary matching strings from either the
spawn filters or the spawn alerts.
